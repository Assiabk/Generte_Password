Random Password Generator
This Python script generates a random password of a specified length. It utilizes the random module to select characters from different categories to create a strong and secure password.

Usage
The generate_password function takes an optional argument length that specifies the desired length of the password. If no length is provided, it defaults to 6 characters. The function returns a string containing the generated password.

To generate a password, simply call the generate_password function and assign the returned value to a variable. For example:

python

password = generate_password()
print(password)
This will generate a random password and print it to the console.

Password Strength
The password generated by this script is designed to be strong and secure by including characters from different categories:

Lowercase letters (a-z)
Uppercase letters (A-Z)
Digits (0-9)
Special characters (!@#$%^&*()-_=+{}[]:;"<>,.?)
By including characters from these categories, the generated password becomes more resistant to guessing and brute-force attacks.

Customizing Password Length
If you want to generate a password of a specific length, you can pass the desired length as an argument to the generate_password function. For example, to generate a password of length 8, you can do:

python
password = generate_password(length=8)
Disclaimer
While this script generates strong passwords, it is important to note that password security also depends on other factors such as password storage, usage, and handling. Always follow best practices for password management and security to ensure the safety of your sensitive information.

Note: This script was written based on Python 3.x syntax. Make sure you have a compatible version of Python installed to run the script successfully.
